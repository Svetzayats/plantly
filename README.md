# Plantly üå±

This is a simple plant care tracking app. You can add your plants, specify how often they need to be watered, and keep track of the last time you watered each one.

I built this app as part of the excellent course [Intermediate React Native, v2 by Kadi Kraman on Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/intermediate-react-native-v2/). It was a great opportunity to deepen my skills in mobile development using React Native and Expo.

## Some Insights & Highlights

### Screens & Navigation

Implemented routing using **`Expo Router`** with a combination of stacks and tabs:

- Onboarding Screen: Displayed on first launch before entering the main app.
- Main Navigation: Built with bottom tabs:
  - Home ‚Äì list of added plants and access to detailed views
  - Profile ‚Äì user-related info/settings
- Home Stack:
  - Plant List ‚Äì displays all saved plants
  - Plant Card ‚Äì detailed view with watering info and actions
- Modal Stack:
  -New Plant Form ‚Äì allows users to add a new plant

Getting familiar with the navigation structure ‚Äî especially with groups and \_layout.tsx files ‚Äî was a bit challenging at first. But once I got used to it, the logic behind it became clear. But I need practice with it, I know ;)

### Custom Font Integration

Used **`@expo-font`** and **`@expo-google-fonts/caveat`** to apply a custom handwritten font across the app. Handled platform differences using `Platform.select`:

- On Android, the font can be referenced directly by file name.
- On iOS, you need to install the font in Font Book and use the PostScript Name instead.

```ts
// onboarding.tsx
fontFamily: Platform.select({
      android: "Caveat_400Regular.ttf",
      ios: "Caveat-Regular",
    }),
```

### Working with Dates

Used **`date-fns`** for formatting and calculating dates (e.g., tracking last watering time, calculating next watering date).

In my previous projects, I used dayjs, but for this app I tried date-fns ‚Äî and really liked it. Its functional approach feels intuitive and composable. I‚Äôm definitely planning to use it again in future projects.

### Plant Photo Upload & Storage

Used **`expo-image-picker`** to allow users to upload a photo for each plant. Built a custom Image component to display either the uploaded image or a default placeholder.

On form submission, images are saved to device storage using **`expo-file-system`**.

One tricky part I encountered: after running `npx expo run:ios`, all stored images were gone. I learned that each build creates a new sandboxed environment, so previously saved files are wiped. It was not obvious ;)

### State Management

Used **`Zustand`** to manage global state such as the list of plants or user settings. It was handy for storing data in Async storage.

In my previous React projects, I relied on composition and React Context without introducing external state libraries. I was genuinely delighted by how convenient and lightweight Zustand is. The experience felt effortless, and I‚Äôll definitely consider using it again in future projects.

For examples check `plantStore.ts` or `userStore.ts`.

### Quick Actions Integration

Used **`expo-quick-actions`** to add a shortcut for quickly opening the Add Plant form directly from the home screen icon (long-press gesture on supported devices).

### Haptic Feedback for Button Presses

Implemented subtle haptic feedback using expo-haptics to enhance the tactile experience when interacting with buttons.

Created a custom button component that triggers feedback on press:

```tsx
// PlantlyButton.tsx
function handlePress() {
  onPress();
  if (Platform.OS !== "web") {
    Haptics.impactAsync(Haptics.ImpactFeedbackStyle.Light);
  }
}
```

## Takeaways

- Building native apps with React Native and Expo is surprisingly convenient ‚Äî it's easy to get started and very rewarding.

- Expo provides a wide range of tools and libraries out of the box. There's still a lot to explore, and I‚Äôm excited to dig deeper.

- Platform-specific nuances between iOS and Android are inevitable. Some are covered in courses, but many you need to learn through experience ‚Äî it‚Äôs important to stay flexible and not get discouraged.

- Publishing to app stores can be a complex and time-consuming process. In some cases, building a PWA might be a more practical alternative.

- I appreciated Kadi Kraman‚Äôs approach to component naming: prefixing components with the project name (e.g., PlantlyButton) helps avoid naming collisions with library components.

- Creating a centralized `theme.ts` file for storing colors, spacing, and other design tokens made it easier to maintain consistent styling across the app.
